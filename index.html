    <h3> Tesla introduces a moratorium on hiring and plans staff cuts </h3>
    <p> Tesla has informed its employees that it is introducing a moratorium on hiring, and plans to start layoffs in the next quarter. The information got to Electrek thanks to "a source familiar with the issue." In June of this year, Elon Musk already addressed the company's top management with a similar proposal: then the hiring was also frozen, and the staff was reduced by 10%.

Analyzing the situation, Electrek recalls that at that time the "hiring pause" even caused more concern, since Tesla is developing several programs rapidly, and it needs to hire thousands of people to new factories in the USA and Germany.

Six months ago, Musk voiced various reasons for layoffs, including a "very bad feeling" about the economy. Now journalists tend to associate the reduction of personnel with the fall in Tesla shares and the acquisition of Twitter.

    <h3> NASA Information security does not meet the required standard of the US government </h3>
    <p> The Office of the Inspector General of NASA (OIG) has published the results of the annual audit of the agency's IT systems from the point of view of information security. The overall assessment is "Ineffective," The Register reports.

The review was conducted by RMA Associates. Analysts concluded that NASA's IT systems in the period from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 did not show an optimal level of security for any of the nine parameters, including credential management, data protection, risk management and others. 

The auditors note that NASA does not have the tools and data to understand the location and condition of its IT infrastructure, there are no processes to identify risks and respond to them. Among the conclusions of the document, it is also indicated that NASA does not identify all the network devices it manages and does not keep a register of them. The agency has not evaluated cybersecurity personnel since 2016 and is unable to understand whether employees have the skills to properly protect themselves.</p>
